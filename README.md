### Description
Welcome to my portfolio of full-stack web development projects. 

### Technologies Used
Nearly all projects have used HTML, some form of CSS, and either JavaScript of jQuery. Handlebars, React, Node, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, and Sequelize have also been used. Additionally, hosting by Heroku and Firebase were also necessary for some of the apps.

### Future Development
All projects are works in progress as I refactor code, learn and implement new CSS libraries, and add new projects.
